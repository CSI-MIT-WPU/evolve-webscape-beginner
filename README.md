# Webscape Challenge (Beginner)

Welcome to the DevConnect social media website challenge! This project aims to create a simple yet functional social media interface that allows users to view and create posts, manage their profile, and interact with other users. Your goal is to build an engaging user experience using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## User Story

As a social media user, I want to interact with a simple platform where I can view posts from other users and create my own posts, so that I can participate in a developer-focused social community.

## Key Expectations

- **Main Feed**: A central area showing posts from users with interaction capabilities
- **Profile Section**: User profile display with statistics and information
- **Friends List**: Display of online friends with status indicators

## Important!!!

### Navbar and Friends List

Do not change the contents of the Navbar and Friends List sections. You are only allowed to modify their appearance (such as color, font, layout, etc.).

### Other Sections

You have full freedom to modify any other sections of the website. This includes the Profile Card, Posts Section, and any additional content areas. Feel free to adjust the content, layout, and styling as needed to showcase your creativity and skills.
