## User Story 👤

As a social media user, I want to interact with a simple platform where I can view posts from other users and create my own posts, so that I can participate in a developer-focused social community.

## Key Expectations 🎯

- **Main Feed** 📱: A central area showing posts from users with interaction capabilities
- **Profile Section** 👤: User profile display with statistics and information
- **Friends List** 👥: Display of online friends with status indicators

### Navbar and Friends List

### Other Sections

You have full freedom to modify any other sections of the website. This includes the Profile Card, Posts Section, and any additional content areas. Feel free to adjust the content, layout, and styling as needed to showcase your creativity and skills.
